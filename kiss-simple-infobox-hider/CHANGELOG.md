# CHANGELOG
 - 0.0.4:
  - Made script more reliable.
   - The document ready event might have fired before the script was run. Now it fires independently.
  - Now uses a run-at tag to determine start time.
   - This feature is not supported by Greasemonkey and that results in a minimal later loading using Firefox.
   - Use Scriptish instead of Greasemonkey if you want to be a little bit faster.
 - 0.0.3:
  - Made script load earlier. Now it does not wait for the ads to load.
 - 0.0.2:
  - Fix kisscartoon url
 - 0.0.1:
  - first release
